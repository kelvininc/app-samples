# Welcome to Kelvin SDK - App Samples
This repository contains sample applications that demonstrate how to use the **Kelvin SDK**. 

We recommend that you start first by reading the official Kelvin Documentation on https://docs.kelvin.ai.

# Applications

| Application | Type | Level | Description |
| ----------- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| [Event Detection](event-detection/) | Event Detection | Beginner | This application demonstrates how to use the Kelvin SDK to detect events above a pre-defined threshold in streaming data and emit a Control Change output. |
| [Event Detection (Complex)](event-detection-complex/) | Event Detection | Intermediate | This application demonstrates how to use the Kelvin SDK to detect events above a pre-defined threshold in streaming data and emit a Control Change or Recommendation. This example also leverages Asset Parameters and App Configuration to make the application more dynamic. |
| [Rolling Window DataFrame](rolling-window-dataframe/) | Rolling Window | Beginner | This application demonstrates the usage of the Kelvin SDK to implement a rolling window of data points using Pandas. |
